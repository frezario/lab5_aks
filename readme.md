### Prerequisites

C/C++ compiler, CMake, python3

### Compilation

```
./compile.sh --no-debug-build --optimize-build
```

### Usage

To run a script:
- that show the graph of points and time:
```
python3 estimate_points.py
```
- that show the graph of times with and without thread pool:
```
python3 plot.py
```
- that show the graph with acceleration:

```
python3 acceleration.py
```
To run the c++ program, compile it and run as:

```
./compile.sh --no-debug-build --optimize-build
 cd cmake-build-release/
./integrate_parallel_tpool ../func1.cfg 1 4 100
```

### Important!

To write a clean code, we've made a strong assumption that user will chose only those amount of points per interval, which is reasonable to build a rectangle interval with. That's because in the opposite case the computations used to determine the size of each subinterval become too complex and boilerplate. Also, the subintervals would be of different size and in some cases will be unrepresantable as rectangles.

### Results

We've made an alternative to prvious integral computating program using thread-safe queue. Although, the result is not better than previous one, we've learned another good general way to parallelize computations.

#### Determination of the optimal number of points

This results for case when max iteration in config file is 7 and with 4 threads.

The second graph is unstable and all time values are similar, so we took 50 points as the optimal amount. It should be noted that the size of the interval per thread directly depends on the maximum iterations in config file, as the number of intervals increases with each iteration.

#### Compare with and without queue

We used determined number of points to compare programs with and without queue.

Here also, as we take small number of points, script with queue works faster with more threads.

#### Acceleration of parallelization

As $n$ - the number of threads increase, the coefficient decreases due to dividing the function by $n$.
